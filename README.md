BlackBoard LMS Sugar
====================

Sweet custom [user-script](https://greasyfork.org/) enhancements for [BlackBoard Learn LMS](http://uki.blackboard.com/sites/international/globalmaster/Platforms/Blackboard-Learn.html)'s instructors.

Install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) add-on for Firefox, restart Firefox, go to [this link](https://github.com/pavkriz/blackboard-sugar/raw/master/blackboard_sugar.user.js) and confirm installation in Greasemonkey. Now when you go to Grade center in Blackboard, you'll see pretty green button "UHK: Pretty table".

Developed by Pavel Kriz for use at the [University of Hradec Kralove](www.uhk.cz).
